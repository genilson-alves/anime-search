This project was developed using React, Bootstrap and Jikan API. It was done to test my abilities and to learn more about front-end technologies.

The website has as functionalities:
* Get anime and manga information from <a href="https://myanimelist.net/" target="_blank">MyAnimeList</a> using JikanAPI.
* Display the current airing season.
* Display the search done by the user.
